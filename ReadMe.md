#PathRasterize: an experiment on hybrid rendering

During the summer of 2020 at the CNAM:ENJMIN we can either do an internship or do some research. I wanted to do some research on ray tracing so here we are :).
My work is to see how we can render some good quality effects with ray tracing while maintaining a real-time framerate.

Some keywords used in my work: BVH, compute shaders, Unity, Rasterization and ray tracing.

If you have any question about my work please feel free to contact me !
